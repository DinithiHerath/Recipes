            From fiery curries to fragrant rice dishes, Sri Lankan food showcases a rich tapestry of history and culture. Explore the fascinating historical and cultural stories behind Sri Lankan cuisine and embark on a gastronomic journey that will tantalize your taste buds and awaken your senses!</b>
          <p style="text-align: justify;" >Sri Lankan cuisine is known for its particular combinations of herbs, spices, fish, vegetables, rices, and fruits. The cuisine is highly centered around many varieties of rice, as well as coconut which is a ubiquitous plant throughout the country. 
            Seafood also plays a significant role in the cuisine, be it fresh fish or preserved fish. 
            As a country that was a hub in the historic oceanic silk road, contact with foreign traders brought new food items and cultural influences in addition to the local traditions of the country's ethnic groups, all of which have helped shape Sri Lankan cuisine. 
            Influences from Indian (particularly South Indian), Indonesian and Dutch cuisines are most evident with Sri Lankan cuisine sharing close ties to other neighbouring South and Southeast Asian cuisines.<br><br>
          
            1.<i>Spices:</i><br>
            Sri Lankan cuisine is heavily influenced by the country's rich spice trade history. A wide variety of spices, including cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, coriander, cumin, and curry leaves, are used generously in Sri Lankan dishes. 
            This creates a complex and aromatic flavor profile.<br><br>

        <P><b>"Savor the explosion of flavors in every bite of Indian cuisine, where spices are not just ingredients but storytellers."</b></P>
        <p style="text-align: justify;" >Indian food is different from rest of the world not only in taste but also in cooking methods. It reflects a perfect blend of various cultures and ages. 
          Just like Indian culture, food in India has also been influenced by various civilizations, which have contributed their share in its overall development and the present form.<br>
        
          India has a rich culinary heritage. Indian cuisine has a 5000-year-old history. Mythological beliefs and traditions have played an important role in its evolution and development. 
          The main Indian food was based on Hinduism but the Islamic influence during the Mughal era, the Persian exchanges with the Middle East and the British colonial system have all contributed immensely towards laying the foundation of the Indian cuisine.<br><br>
          1.The staple Indian foods are Rice, Wheat and Lentils. And no Indian dish is complete without spices. Indian food is a combination of all six tastes like sweet, sour, salty, bitter, spicy and astringent.<br><br>

        Western cuisine delights with flavors sublime.
        From juicy steaks to creamy pastas so divine,
        A culinary journey that's truly fine."</b></p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;" >Western Food can be cooked with simple method people say that you just have to read the cookbook and it’s done. It’s not as complicated as Chinese Food.<br>
        Western Food or Western cuisine is the cuisines of Europe and the other Western country. Sometimes when someone said “western food”, we’ll think about burger,steak,fries,ribs,etc. and that’s right!<br>
        <br><i>And now,how about the food characteristics?</i><br>
        For Asian, the Western Food have a jumbo size, but for them it’s only a regular size. The Asian can feel very full with the western size serving, but not for them.<br>
        <br><i>And about the food?</i><br>
        Meat is so important in western food (example: steak). It is like the main star, not like the Asian cuisine. in the Asian cuisine meat is only a small part in the food,their main food is more like rice or noodle. The Western also more using the corn, fries, steamed veggies, and mashed potatoes than the rice.<br>

          <h2><u>Rice and Curry</u></h2><br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">which is widely consumed on a daily basis in many households. From tiny white “Samba” rice to the long grained “Basmathi” rice, and many Red Raw Rice specialities, Sri Lankans have been dependent on this staple since the golden era of mighty kings and warriors who managed to flourish the land with crops and various commodities.

Rice and Curry which is also referred as the National Dish of the island, has a variety of mouthwatering accompaniments which will keep your taste-buds dancing to a rhythm of fiery desire. The curries usually consist of one meat or fish dish which is quite spicy, two or three different types of vegetable curries, a mallum (a mix of finely chopped green leaves mixed well with grated Coconut, lime and salt) a spicy sambal or chutney and finally a papadam (a thin fried wafer).

The curries should ideally consist of a gravy so that the rice can be well amalgamated with the rest. All of these dishes are quite spicy but there are mild yellow curries such as “Dhal” or “Potato” that are infused with Coconut Milk so that the flavours are well balanced. Sri Lankans are famous for incorporating their herbs and Spices while sliced onions, green Chillies, Cinnamon, Black Pepper, Cloves, nutmeg, Cardamom, saffron, Curry Leaves, Tamarind paste, Ginger and Garlic are used to add more punch and flavour in the cooking.

While fish and Chicken are the main types of proteins used, some prefer tempered dried fish, fish cutlets or even eggs. Vegetarians are in for a treat since the seasonal local produce offers so many mouthwatering vegetables such as Jack Fruit, bread fruit, banana flowers, beans, okra, Brinjals or even Fruits that are cooked into chutneys and curries such as mango and ambarella (June Plum).</p>

            <li>Warm water (as needed)</li>

            <b>Cooking Instructions</b>
            <ol style="text-align: justify;">
              <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the whole wheat flour and salt. </li>
              <li>Add the oil and mix it into the flour using your fingertips until it resembles a crumbly texture. </li>
              <li>Gradually add warm water to the flour mixture, a little at a time, and knead the dough. Keep adding water and kneading until you have a smooth and pliable dough. </li>
              <li>Once the dough is well-kneaded, cover it with a damp cloth or plastic wrap and let it rest for about 15-20 minutes. </li>
              <li>After resting, divide the dough into small equal-sized balls, roughly the size of a golf ball.</li>
              <li>Take one dough ball and flatten it slightly with your palm. Dust it with some flour and roll it out into a thin, round disc using a rolling pin. Make sure to dust with flour as needed to prevent sticking.</li>
              <li>Heat a tawa (flat griddle) or a non-stick pan over medium-high heat.</li>
              <li>Place the rolled-out chapati onto the hot tawa and let it cook for about 30 seconds or until you see small bubbles forming on the surface.</li>
              <li>Flip the chapati and let the other side cook for another 30 seconds.</li>
              <li>Now, lift the chapati with a pair of tongs or a spatula and place it directly over an open flame (gas stove) or on an electric coil for a few seconds until it puffs up. Be careful not to burn it; move it around if needed to ensure even cooking.</li>
              <li>Remove the cooked chapati from the flame and transfer it to a plate. You can apply a small amount of ghee or butter on top if desired.</li>
              <li>Repeat the process with the remaining dough balls until all the chapatis are cooked.</li>
              <li>Serve the hot and freshly made chapatis with your favorite curries, vegetables, or chutneys.</li>

            <h2><u>Laddu</u></h2><br>
            <b>Main ingredients:</b>
            <ul>
            <li>1 cup chickpea flour (besan)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup ghee (clarified butter)</li>
            <li>3/4 cup powdered sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 cup powdered sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped nuts (such as almonds or cashews)</li>
            <li>Raisins for garnish (optional)</li>
            </ul><br>
  
             <ol style="text-align: justify;">
                <li>Heat a pan on low heat and add ghee. Let it melt.</li>
                <li>Add chickpea flour (besan) to the pan and roast it on low heat. Keep stirring continuously to avoid burning.</li>
                <li>Roast the besan until it turns golden brown and emits a nutty aroma. This process may take around 10-12 minutes.</li>
                <li>Once the besan is roasted, remove the pan from heat and let it cool for a few minutes.</li>
                <li>Add powdered sugar and cardamom powder to the roasted besan. Mix well to combine all the ingredients evenly.</li>
                <li>Allow the mixture to cool down completely. At this stage, it should be warm enough to handle.</li>
                <li>Take a small portion of the mixture and shape it into a round ball (laddu) with your hands. Repeat the process for the remaining mixture.</li>
                <li>Optional: Press a raisin into the center of each laddu for garnish.</li>
                <li>Place the laddus on a plate and let them cool and firm up for about 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Once cooled and set, the besan laddus are ready to be served. Enjoy!</li>

            <li>Preheat your grill or a skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Divide the ground beef into equal portions, typically around ¼ to ⅓ pound each. Shape them into patties, about ¾-inch thick. Make a slight indentation in the center of each patty to prevent it from puffing up during cooking.</li>
            <li>Season both sides of the patties with salt and black pepper. </li>
            <li>Place the patties on the grill or skillet and cook for about 4-5 minutes on one side. Flip the patties and continue cooking for an additional 4-5 minutes, or until desired level of doneness is reached. </li>
            <li>In the last minute of cooking, place a slice of cheese on top of each patty to allow it to melt.</li>
            <li>While the patties are cooking, lightly toast the burger buns on the grill or in a toaster.</li>
            <li>Assemble the burger: Spread a thin layer of ketchup and mustard on the bottom half of each bun. Place a lettuce leaf, tomato slice, and onion slice on top. Add the cooked cheeseburger patty and top it with pickle slices. Cover with the top half of the bun.</li>
            <li>Serve the cheeseburgers hot and enjoy!</li>

                <li>Cover each sandwich with the remaining 4 slices of bread to form a sandwich.</li>
                <li>Pour the prepared béchamel sauce evenly over the top of each sandwich.</li>
                <li>Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for about 15-20 minutes until the sandwiches are golden and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
                <li>Once done, remove the Croque Monsieur sandwiches from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes before serving.</li>
